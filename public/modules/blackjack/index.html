          content="The age old classic, Blackjack is now available to play for free online from your smartphone, mobile phone or computer. Play from anywhere no matter where you are - including during your office meetings that you love so much. Just don&#x2019;t let your boss catch you with your phone out! Your co-workers are probably playing the same game with their own smartphones! This is the same old Blackjack you know the game, right? The idea is to beat the house by netting as close to twenty-one as possible. If you&#x2019;ve never played before it seems a lot easier than it actually is, so don&#x2019;t get too cocky. The dealer will continue to hand out cards until you bust by getting a total well over twenty-one, or until you tell them to stop. To win, you must be closer to twenty-one than the house, otherwise known as the dealer. Place a bet before every hand, and if you win you&#x2019;ll increase your earnings. Don&#x2019;t raise your bet too high though or you will lose all of your cash if the house beats you! The beauty of this online card game is that you don&#x2019;t have to visit a casino to play, and you don&#x2019;t have to lose real money. Heck, you don&#x2019;t even have to leave your house to get in on the action! Just pull up a chair, plop yourself down and start tossing money onto the table. Keep a close eye on your cards though, you don&#x2019;t want to bust and lose what you&#x2019;ve put down. Well, what are you waiting for? Get in there and place some bets! Challenge your friends and family and compete to see who can make the most money in Blackjack. How much will you make? Will you become a Blackjack millionaire? There&#x2019;s only one way to find out.">
